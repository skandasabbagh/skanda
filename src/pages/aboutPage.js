              Skanda studied music performance and composition, graduating from
              Kingston University and was awarded a travel scholarship to extend
              his studies in West African Percussion and arranging. Skanda has
              studied by ear with numerous masters including Moustapha Tettey
              Ade (Ghana Accra), Kisama Djabate (Dakar, Senegal), Sidiki Dembele
              (Abidjan, Ivory Coast), Khalifa Conte (Dakar, Senegal), Gnawa Dar

              It's not always about the moneyâ€”Skanda is also a liaison for Arts
              Council England, specialising in the development and capacity
              building of Black and Brown-led music organisations and artists.
              His work also addresses the at-risk grassroots ecology of UK
              music, supporting music venues, festivals, and recording studios
              facing potential closure.
